        <p>Protected regions throughout the world perform many functions. They are essential for conserving biodiversity and delivering vital ecosystem services, such as safeguarding watersheds and soils and shielding human communities from natural disasters.</p>

         <h3><a href=" https://novascotia.ca/nse/protectedareas/definition.asp" target="_blank">Why are protected areas important?</a></h3>
        
        <body>

            <p> Many protected areas are important to local communities. They are places for people to get a sense of peace in a busy world - places that invigorate human spirits and challenge the senses. Protected landscapes embody important cultural values; some of them reflect sustainable land use practices. They are important also for research and education, and contribute significantly to local and regional economies, most obviously from tourism and recreation.</p>

        <h3><a href=" https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA" target="_blank">Protected Areas (WDPA)</a></h3>
        <body>
            <p>The Global Database on Protected Area Management Effectiveness (GD-PAME) is the most comprehensive global database of management effectiveness assessments for protected areas. It indicates if a protected area documented in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) has been assessed. The GD-PAME is a searchable database that includes assessments submitted by a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organizations to UNEP-WCMC and is updated on a monthly basis.</p>

        <body>
            <p>The PoWPA enshrines the development of participatory, ecologically representative and effectively managed national and regional systems of protected areas, where necessary, stretching across national boundaries. From designation to management, the PoWPA can be considered a defining framework or “blueprint” for protected areas for the coming decades. Furthermore, it is a framework for cooperation between Governments, donors, NGOs and local communities, for, without such collaboration, programmes cannot be successful and sustainable over the long term.</p>

        <h3><a href=" https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/equity?tab=Results" target="_blank">Equitable Governance</a></h3>
        <body>
            <p>There are several ongoing initiatives investigating how to measure equity in the governance and management of protected areas, including within the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. Such initiatives are needed because existing methods of assessing the quality of protected areas, such as management effectiveness assessments, have been found to sometimes be inadequate for assessing equitable management .</p>
